## project
This project is about developping a software application where users can message each other in groups or with direct messages. There will be different channels to keep the discussions organized by topic and there will be two types of users: Admins and members.
The admin will be able to moderate conversations to keep them appropriate while being able to create and delete channels. Users will be able to send and view messages in these channels.

### specifications
Our team has decided to build the application as a web app while using these frameworks and languages:

Frontend => ReactJS
Backend => PHP (laravel)
Database => mySQL (included in laravel)

### features
Three core features will be implemented in this web app.

#### first
The first of these features will be a group messaging system in specific channels so that users can discuss whatever it is they which to get help on or talk about in a channel specific to that subject.

#### second
The second feature will be a direct messaging system where users can message each other directly to have a private conversation.

#### third
The third feature will be a hierarchy of users, specifically, there will be admins and members where the admins can moderate conversations by deleting messages and also create/delete channels in which the members can send and view messages.

Another feature that is to be determined will be implemented as a part of this project.
